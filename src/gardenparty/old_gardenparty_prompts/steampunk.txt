Enhance the drawing with steampunk elements such as gears, airships, and mechanical devices. Add Victorian-style architecture with clockwork features, steam billowing from chimneys, and inventors interacting with complex machinery. Use warm metallic tones and soft sepia lighting to create a vintage, adventurous feel. Subtly include symbols of knowledge, like scrolls or blueprint stations, to emphasize community learning within this mechanical wonderland.
