Elevate the drawing with a serene, mystical monastery high in the mountains. Add elements like ancient stone structures, flowing robes, and floating lanterns that light the foggy surroundings. Include characters in meditative poses or sharing scrolls, highlighting communal learning and spiritual connection. Use soft blues, whites, and gentle golden lights to create a tranquil, uplifting atmosphere that feels both ancient and sacred.
