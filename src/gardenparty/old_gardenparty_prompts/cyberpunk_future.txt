Upgrade the existing artwork to reflect a neon-lit cyberpunk cityscape. Add holograms, digital billboards, and futuristic technology intertwined with gritty urban life. Use vibrant neon colors like blues, pinks, and purples, and emphasize the mix of high-tech and low-life elements. Show characters interacting with advanced virtual interfaces or engaging in community spaces where knowledge and technology converge, reflecting a rebellious but connected information hub.
