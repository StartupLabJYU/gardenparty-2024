Elevate the drawing with elements of a majestic ice kingdom. Add grand ice castles, snow-covered trees, and magical creatures like ice dragons or snow foxes. Include characters interacting in communal spaces, like gathering around an ice sculpture or sharing stories in a cozy ice pavilion. Use cool blues, silvers, and subtle glows to create a magical, wintry atmosphere that feels both enchanting and communal.
