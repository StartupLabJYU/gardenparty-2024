Add elements like alchemy labs, floating orbs of light, and interactive magical displays. Highlight moments of learning and collaboration, with students sharing spells, discussing theories, or practicing magic together. Use deep purples, blues, and warm golden lights to create an academic yet mystical atmosphere that emphasizes the excitement of communal learning.
