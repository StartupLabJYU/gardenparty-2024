Analyze the drawingâ€™s Halloween elements and expand it into a spooky, yet fun-filled Halloween night scene. Transform basic sketches of pumpkins, ghosts, or witches into a vibrant, eerie setting with glowing jack-o'-lanterns lining dark, foggy streets, haunted houses in the background, and playful trick-or-treaters in colorful costumes. Use a mix of warm orange, eerie green, and deep purple tones to create a festive yet spooky atmosphere. Add subtle details like bats flying across a full moon, and glowing candles to immerse the viewer in the Halloween spirit.
