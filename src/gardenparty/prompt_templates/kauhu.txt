Understand the drawingâ€™s horror elements and turn it into a dark, chilling horror scene. Expand sketches of monsters, eerie figures, or haunted places into a full environment filled with tension and dread. Use shadowy lighting, with deep blacks, blood reds, and desaturated greys to evoke fear and unease. Transform simple figures into realistic, terrifying creatures lurking in dark corners, and add fog, dilapidated buildings, or creepy forests to intensify the horror. Focus on creating an ominous atmosphere, where every detail contributes to a feeling of lurking danger and suspense.
